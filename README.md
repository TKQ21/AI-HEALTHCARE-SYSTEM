AI Healthcare System

AI Healthcare System is a structured AI-based healthcare support platform designed to assist in emergency assessment, symptom analysis, and medical care guidance.

This system combines three intelligent modules into one unified interface.

🔹 Module 1: Emergency Severity Assessment

This module evaluates how urgent a patient's condition may be based on symptom inputs.

It categorizes cases into:

Green – Routine

Yellow – Urgent

Red – Emergency

The goal is to support early triage and reduce delay in critical cases.

🔹 Module 2: Conversational Clinical Reasoning

This module uses guided AI conversation to:

Ask structured medical questions

Analyze symptom patterns

Suggest possible clinical directions

It supports decision clarity but does not provide medical diagnosis.

🔹 Module 3: Care Guidance Engine

Based on symptom severity and conversation analysis, this module helps determine:

Immediate emergency visit required

Same-day doctor consultation

Scheduled appointment

Safe monitoring

🎯 Purpose

AI Healthcare System is designed to:

Support healthcare workflow efficiency

Assist in emergency triage
